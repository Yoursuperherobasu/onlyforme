"""Permission scope checks for Microsoft Graph connectors (Outlook / SharePoint / Teams).

The connectors auto-discover what permissions the Azure AD app registration has been
granted by parsing data Microsoft already returns:

- **Delegated flows (Outlook, Teams)**: the OAuth token response contains a ``scope``
  field listing the *actually granted* scopes (which may be fewer than what we asked
  for if the app reg was set up with reduced permissions).
- **App-only flows (SharePoint)**: the access token JWT contains a ``roles`` claim
  with the granted Application permissions.

Each connector persists the discovered list (``granted_scopes`` or ``granted_roles``)
into its existing ``provider_config`` JSON column. Read paths never check this list —
they always run. Write paths call :func:`require_scope` which raises
:class:`ConnectorPermissionError` (translated to HTTP 403 at the API boundary) when
the required permission is missing.

Permissive fallback: when the granted list is empty (e.g. legacy connectors created
before this module existed, or token-response parsing failed), every check passes.
This guarantees zero regression for existing deployments — the gates only activate
once a connector has been (re)linked under the new code path.
